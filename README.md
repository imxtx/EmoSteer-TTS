We are developing a PyPi package that will support a broader range of TTS models and offer extensible development capabilities, and we expect to release it within the next few months. Thank you for your patience.

TODO

- [x] Release the dataset
- [ ] Release the precomputed steering vectors
- [ ] Release the PyPi package

## Dataset

If you wish to compute your own steering vectors for emotion interpolation, the `dataset` folder includes the full set of 6,900 curated samples used in our paper. We are planing to scale it up in the future.
